Original fDynamo files have been renamed to *.orig

edit the makefiles to fulfill your system

default compiler is Intel Fortran Compiler (C + Fortran), but this can be changed.
(gfortran 4.1 complains, so update to a higher version...)


in order to compile your source code type:

make -f PATH/makefile.gnu SRC=source.f90

being PATH current directory (you should also had modified makefile.gnu
HOME variable in order to work properly)


Note of caution for moving binary files among systems:

"GFortran 4.2 and 4.3 use now 4-byte record markers by default for
unformatted files to be compatible with g77 and most other compilers.
The implementation allows for records bigger than 2 GB, compatible with
several other compilers. Older versions of GFortran used by default
8-byte record markers (on most systems); in order to change length of
record markers, e.g. to the read unformatted files created by older
gfortran versions, the -frecord-marker=8 option can be used."

Thus when moving from Intel compilres to GFortran 4.1 use -frecord-marker=4
